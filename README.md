# Avocado

Avocado is a general propouse, functional, static and strong typed
programming language inspired and based on LISP family. Avocado is
currently a toy, as I work on it I might convert it into a more formal
solution, but I don't plan anything like that yet in the near future.

## Avocado C compiler

This repository holds the C compiler and the first specification
of the language.

## Version 0.0.1
